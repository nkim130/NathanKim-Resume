        <div class="subheading mb-5">ü•ã Taekwondo Instructor ü•ã</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My education has not been limited to a conventional classroom. More than 10 years of Taekwondo training has provided an education in life skills. Unlike many contact and combat sports, martial arts teaches respect and mental strength through physical discipline. As a Taekwondo instructor for the past four years, I constantly ask myself ‚ÄúWhat do I want my students to learn from me?‚Äù
One of my responsibilities as a black belt instructor is to coach our students at local competitions. Last year, I was ringside preparing to coach a very anxious 12 year old student named Lucy at her very first tournament. To calm her down, I started a casual conversation and reviewed some defensive and offensive sparring strategies to keep her focused before her sparring match. As she fought, I could see that she was putting in maximum effort although she was outmatched by her opponent in the ring.
When she looked at the final score, she saw that she had lost. She started to tear up. I was already preparing some positive things to say to cheer her up and lessen her disappointment, but she surprised me when she said that she was crying out of happiness. She said she was proud of herself for trying her best. At that moment, I realized that I had witnessed a pivotal moment in her life. She had a breakthrough in overcoming her fear and moving beyond her perceived limits. It was really gratifying not only to have witnessed it, but also to have been a part of helping her through the experience. 
Not every student will have gold medal victories, but I‚Äôve become more aware that my role as an instructor is more than just teaching techniques. I contribute to the lives of others by guiding young students to better themselves and to maximize their own potential to keep moving forward past fear and disappointment so that they can achieve long term success in life beyond the limits of a sports ring.
